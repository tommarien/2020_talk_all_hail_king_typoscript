### Typescript 🤷‍♂️

- It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

🤓 Demo <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Stress the fact that even if there are type issues, typescript still compiles to js.

### Guiding Principle

💥 They include stage 3 JavaScript features and contribute to TC39 committees. (except `enum` and [experimental decorators](https://tc39.es/proposal-decorators/) (stage 2))
